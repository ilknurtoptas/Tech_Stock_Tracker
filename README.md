# Tech Stock Tracker
## Stock Visualization & Calculator
 
### Overview

This project is a stock visualization and projection calculator designed to help users analyze stock market trends and estimate potential returns on investment. It provides interactive charts, regression analysis, and a stock value projection tool. Users can visualize stock data using different graph types such as candlestick charts, regression graphs, pie charts, and treemaps. The calculator feature allows users to input an investment amount, select a stock and date range, and see the projected return based on historical data.

For small to medium traders, this tool offers valuable insights into market trends, helping them make informed decisions. By utilizing historical stock data, traders can identify patterns, assess volatility, and determine the potential profitability of an investment. The regression graph and candlestick charts allow traders to analyze price movements over time, while the calculator function provides a simplified way to estimate returns based on past performance. This empowers traders with data-driven decision-making, reducing reliance on speculation and enhancing their trading strategies.
